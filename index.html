            Hey there, how ya doing? My name is Drake Gooding and I do some things. I'm currently learning to code while living in Mexico,
         so that's pretty cool. I spend most of my time coding, training Muay Thai, practicing classical guitar, running, or going to the beach.
         It's a pretty sweet life, if you ask me ;) I am currently working on a few coding projects that I would like to have up and running
         throughout the next few months. Of course, I'm just now learning to code so I am hoping to build these projects as I learn more!</p>

     <p><strong>Crumb:   </strong> Crumb is the nutrition and recipe website that I built along side the very talented Randy Chou and Alex Philbert for our coding bootcamp project #1. 
         This website is connected to a recipe API and a nutrition API, allowing the user to search the database for the perfect recipe, save those recipes to their MY RECIPES tab, and learn about the 
         nutrition info for each ingredient in the recipe. <a href="https://github.com/Randy-chou/crumbs-food-app"> GitHub repository link. </a>

     <br>
     <p><strong>TuneScope:</strong> I'd like to build a site that will select from a large database of music (curated by yours truly)
         to return a randomly selected album. I would like users to be able to sign in so that their previous recommendations will be remembered.
         I would like each recommendation to contain links to the artists website, streaming, possibly music videos, and links to the vinyl version
         of each album. I would also like for people to be able to submit albums of their liking, or their own music, to be considered and possibly
         added to the main list of albums. <a href="https://github.com/Drake-G/TuneScope"> GitHub repository link. </a> </p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Day-Planner:</strong> This is a very simple day planner I built for an assignment in my coding bootcamp. I would like to expand upon this idea by allowing the user to
    dynamically generate blocks of time based on their needs. For me, I'd like to block time using the Pomodoro method. <a href="https://github.com/Drake-G/Day-Planner"> GitHub repository link. </a> </p>
