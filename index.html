            Hey there, how ya doing? My name is Drake Gooding and I do some things. I'm currently learning to code while living in Mexico,
         so that's pretty cool. I spend most of my time coding, training Muay Thai, practicing classical guitar, running, or going to the beach.
         It's a pretty sweet life, if you ask me ;) I am currently working on a few coding projects that I would like to have up and running
         throughout the next few months. Of course, I'm just now learning to code so I am hoping to build these projects as I learn more!</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Album Recommender:</strong> I'd like to build a site that will select from a large database of music (curated by yours truly)
         to return a randomly selected album. I would like users to be able to sign in so that their previous recommendations will be remembered.
         I would like each recommendation to contain links to the artists website, streaming, possibly music videos, and links to the vinyl version
         of each album. I would also like for people to be able to submit albums of their liking, or their own music, to be considered and possibly
         added to the main list of albums. </p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Kicker:</strong> I would like to launch an early 2000s-esque social media site based around bucket lists. Still in the planning phase.</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>Procedural Cave Maze:</strong> I would like to use Perlin Noise and Unity to generate a very simple cave maze game in which a character will have to navigate through randomly
        generated caves in search of the outside world, with each level getting more complex. Think about that time you got lost in a cave in minecraft,
        but now you can't dig your way out!</p>
     <br>
     <p><strong>SpaceCraft:</strong> And now for the big one. I'd like to find a way to create a minecraft-like game in Unity where instead of moving through biomes, you move through
        procedurally generated planets. Different planets would have different terrain types and different native aliens. I feel like this style of game
        could expand on the whole minecraft idea to create a lot more freedom and adventure. I don't even play minecraft, I haven't since I was young, but,
        I still love the concept and I'm so interested in the random terrain generation using Perlin Noise. I think that concept could be utilized to
        generate random solar systems using parameters to generate logical structure for each system and the planets within that system. I have always loved
        Star Wars and so I believe it would be so much fun to try to create a universe with different environments, aliens, and maybe different physics as well. </p>
